So i just wanna know even when the Klipsch are old would it be a smart to buy them at that price?  or woul it be better to go for the pioneer?  Unless the speakers are damaged I would pay $250 for the Klipsch because that sounds like a really good deal, but fwiw, that isn't considered a Klipsch "" High end system. "" Later on if you wanted to upgrade your mains to a Klipsch high end system you could use some of those other speakers in the mix .  Good Luck and welcome to the forum.",Pioneer SP-PK21BS

Time Warner allows their DVR to connect to the AV receiver by HDMI but not Dish .  With Dish I need to hook the TV directly to the Dish DVR and use RCA cables for sound instead of HDMI .  My concern is that I will loose sound quality .  Here is what I have: TV is a Pioneer Elite Pro-141FD AV Receiver is a Pioneer SC-25 Blu Ray Player LG BD390 Here is how I might have to hook it up .  Two HDMI from the TV, one to the DVR and one to the AV Receiver .  Then, RCA cables to the DVR for sound .  HDMI cable from the receiver to the Blu Ray .  Is there a better way to hook this up?  Thanks,",Pioneer Elite Pro-141FD AV Receiver

"Quote: Originally Posted by sparks81 My mistake .  As this is my first time on this thread, I was not aware of these problems. I worked for a dealer that sold the Pioneer and I was never aware of these problems described above .  I also have the BDP-94HD in another system .  No problems with either one except for the firmware updates .  It sounds like Pioneer has resolved these problems.. .hopefully!  have you used the analog outs yet?  If so, what do you think?  I have mine connected both ways to a Theta Digital Cassablanca III .  Analog sounds OK .  But, the digital connection reigns supreme.. .since the DACs in the Theta out perform the Wolfson DACs in the BDP-09 .  The 09 nonetheless, is still a good player .  The BDP-09FD's drive failures seemed to show up for everybody just around the 24 month mark as the 2 year Elite warranty expired.. .. .. I've got my BDP-09FD connected to a Pioneer VSX-59TXi receiver via analogs and think the 09FD is great for decoding the Blu-ray HD audio formats .  I don't use the 09 for music, I use my Pioneer DV-59AVi DVD player for music via the 59AVi's iLink connection to the 59TXi .  I just personally think the digital iLink connection sounds more dynamic and robust than the 09's analog for CDs and the 09 does not play SACD and DVD-Audio discs .  I really like the 09FD as a DVD player and think it may be the best DVD player I've ever seen .  The 59TXi has enough power to compensate for the volume loss from using analog inputs .  It's really weird how great the 09 sounds for movie and concert BDs but doesn't for CDs, maybe I am just spoiled by the 59AVi on music.. . Fred",Pioneer VSX-59TXi receiver
"Wanted to say thanks for the fantastic guide and have enjoyed all of the great information from this community .

"AMD Radeon HD 7970 specifications slide leaked by VR-Zone.com VR-Zone FORUMS PRICEWATCH VIDEOS CHINESE AMD Radeon HD 7970 specifications slide leaked Reported by Sub on Thursday, December 15 2011 4:17 am A slide purportedly to be part of the press deck, detailing Radeon HD 7970, has leaked online .  As previously rumoured, the HD 7970 features the GCN architecture with 32 CUs .  Tweet NEWS A slide purportedly detailing Radeon HD 7970 has leaked online .  The slide resembles AMD's standard presentation design, and is seemingly part of the press deck held .  Aspreviously rumoured, the HD 7970 features the GCN architecture .  The HD 7970 features 32 CU containing 2048 ALUs, clocked at 925 MHz .  This amounts to 3.5 TFLOPS (Single Precision).  TMUs are upped to 128, as expected .  However, ROPs remain at 32 compared to Cayman, which is odd considering the memory bus, as we have observed, is 384-bit .  Memory speed remains unchanged at 5.5 GHz, meaning a 50% boost in memory bandwidth .  The TDP is rated under 300W, while the idle power is incredibly only 3W .  This means a 8-pin + 6-pin power connector configuration .  HD 7970 features 4 display outs - 1x DVI, 2xmini-DisplayPort and 1x HDMI .  Finally, the slide mentions the embargo release date - 9th January 2012 .  Needless to say, faked slides are nothing new for the rumour mill, so the information contained within this slide must be considered with caution .  However, most of the details contained are realistic, and the image of the shroud looks identical to the leaked pictures .

"eSATA Doesn't Work!  Ok, Im at an impasse and I think Ive tried everything, so please someone come up with something new to help me!  I have a brand new HR21-700 running 0x1FE .  I read all the threads about this and I installed a WD10EACS into an Antec MX-1 VERIS enclosure .  Ive tried both the eSATA cable that came with the enclosure and a separately purchased SIIG eSATA cable .  Ive switched the cable ends .  Ive tried I think every variation of starting up  power off HR21, power on external for five minutes, then power up the HR21, a simple red button reboot and all the I can think of variations in between but no love .  It just boots off the internal every time .  Any ideas?",SIIG eSATA cable

"AMD Radeon HD 7970 specifications slide leaked by VR-Zone.com VR-Zone FORUMS PRICEWATCH VIDEOS CHINESE AMD Radeon HD 7970 specifications slide leaked Reported by Sub on Thursday, December 15 2011 4:17 am A slide purportedly to be part of the press deck, detailing Radeon HD 7970, has leaked online .  As previously rumoured, the HD 7970 features the GCN architecture with 32 CUs .  Tweet NEWS A slide purportedly detailing Radeon HD 7970 has leaked online .  The slide resembles AMD's standard presentation design, and is seemingly part of the press deck held .  Aspreviously rumoured, the HD 7970 features the GCN architecture .  The HD 7970 features 32 CU containing 2048 ALUs, clocked at 925 MHz .  This amounts to 3.5 TFLOPS (Single Precision).  TMUs are upped to 128, as expected .  However, ROPs remain at 32 compared to Cayman, which is odd considering the memory bus, as we have observed, is 384-bit .  Memory speed remains unchanged at 5.5 GHz, meaning a 50% boost in memory bandwidth .  The TDP is rated under 300W, while the idle power is incredibly only 3W .  This means a 8-pin + 6-pin power connector configuration .  HD 7970 features 4 display outs - 1x DVI, 2xmini-DisplayPort and 1x HDMI .  Finally, the slide mentions the embargo release date - 9th January 2012 .  Needless to say, faked slides are nothing new for the rumour mill, so the information contained within this slide must be considered with caution .  However, most of the details contained are realistic, and the image of the shroud looks identical to the leaked pictures .

"AMD Radeon HD 7970 specifications slide leaked by VR-Zone.com VR-Zone FORUMS PRICEWATCH VIDEOS CHINESE AMD Radeon HD 7970 specifications slide leaked Reported by Sub on Thursday, December 15 2011 4:17 am A slide purportedly to be part of the press deck, detailing Radeon HD 7970, has leaked online .  As previously rumoured, the HD 7970 features the GCN architecture with 32 CUs .  Tweet NEWS A slide purportedly detailing Radeon HD 7970 has leaked online .  The slide resembles AMD's standard presentation design, and is seemingly part of the press deck held .  Aspreviously rumoured, the HD 7970 features the GCN architecture .  The HD 7970 features 32 CU containing 2048 ALUs, clocked at 925 MHz .  This amounts to 3.5 TFLOPS (Single Precision).  TMUs are upped to 128, as expected .  However, ROPs remain at 32 compared to Cayman, which is odd considering the memory bus, as we have observed, is 384-bit .  Memory speed remains unchanged at 5.5 GHz, meaning a 50% boost in memory bandwidth .  The TDP is rated under 300W, while the idle power is incredibly only 3W .  This means a 8-pin + 6-pin power connector configuration .  HD 7970 features 4 display outs - 1x DVI, 2xmini-DisplayPort and 1x HDMI .

"As of Feb 2012, I'd like to buy a small off-the-shelf HTPC for HDMI hookup to my Sony Bravia KDL 52W4100 HDTV but I'm reading about a lot problems with HDMI audio and complicated work arounds and patches depending on the equipment configuration .  I realize I can use HDMI or VGA or S-Video for picture plus RCA cables for audio, but I'd like to keep it all digital and uncluttered .  That's what HDMI is for, isn't it?  I'm open to any major computer brand running Windows 7 Home as long as it works right out of the box .  My uses are internet, Netflix, Blockbuster, Hulu, Itunes, adult video websites and OpenOffice word processing .  I prefer an HTPC with 4GB RAM, 1TB HD, wireless keyboard and mouse, DVD RW burner, ethernet, memory card readers, HDMI, USB 2 (& USB 3 if possible) and WI FI .  I've looked at specs for the new Mac Mini (with Bootcamp PC partition), HP Slimline, Gateway SX, Lenovo Revo, Dell Inspiron, Acer, Asus, E-Machines, etc. and they all seem to have HDMI audio problems with Sony Bravia, but it's too expensive a TV to replace so I'm building my home entertainment system around it .  I currently use a Sony PS3 for Blue Ray DVD playback and Netflix streaming, but the PS3 Explorer 6 browser is limited in streaming video from other websites and won't accept software upgrades other than from Sony and Netflix .  Can anyone recommend a ready made HTPC for under $1, 000 because I can't build my own .  Thanks.",Sony Bravia KDL 52W4100 HDTV
"I decided to leave Time Warner Cable and go with Dish .  I have the Dish on the house but the technician couldn't get it to work with my home entertainment system .  Time Warner allows their DVR to connect to the AV receiver by HDMI but not Dish .  With Dish I need to hook the TV directly to the Dish DVR and use RCA cables for sound instead of HDMI .  My concern is that I will loose sound quality .  Here is what I have: TV is a Pioneer Elite Pro-141FD AV Receiver is a Pioneer SC-25 Blu Ray Player LG BD390 Here is how I might have to hook it up .  Two HDMI from the TV, one to the DVR and one to the AV Receiver .  Then, RCA cables to the DVR for sound .  HDMI cable from the receiver to the Blu Ray .  Is there a better way to hook this up?  Thanks,",Pioneer SC-25 Blu Ray Player

My speakers are B&W CM-series, with CM9 as frontspeakers, B&W speakers are powerhungry .  I really liked the option to bi-amp frontspeakers AND surround or frontspeakers AND centerspeaker!  As I mentioned earlier, I am still putting in a lot of listening.. But I think at this point I can safely say that there is no decrease in sound quality from the SC37.. . In my room, it is the most neutral (i.e. smooth) Pioneer I have heard.","Pioneer receiver, SC-57"

"AMD Radeon HD 7970 specifications slide leaked by VR-Zone.com VR-Zone FORUMS PRICEWATCH VIDEOS CHINESE AMD Radeon HD 7970 specifications slide leaked Reported by Sub on Thursday, December 15 2011 4:17 am A slide purportedly to be part of the press deck, detailing Radeon HD 7970, has leaked online .  As previously rumoured, the HD 7970 features the GCN architecture with 32 CUs .  Tweet NEWS A slide purportedly detailing Radeon HD 7970 has leaked online .  The slide resembles AMD's standard presentation design, and is seemingly part of the press deck held .  Aspreviously rumoured, the HD 7970 features the GCN architecture .  The HD 7970 features 32 CU containing 2048 ALUs, clocked at 925 MHz .  This amounts to 3.5 TFLOPS (Single Precision).  TMUs are upped to 128, as expected .  However, ROPs remain at 32 compared to Cayman, which is odd considering the memory bus, as we have observed, is 384-bit .  Memory speed remains unchanged at 5.5 GHz, meaning a 50% boost in memory bandwidth .  The TDP is rated under 300W, while the idle power is incredibly only 3W .  This means a 8-pin + 6-pin power connector configuration .  HD 7970 features 4 display outs - 1x DVI, 2xmini-DisplayPort and 1x HDMI .  Finally, the slide mentions the embargo release date - 9th January 2012 .  Needless to say, faked slides are nothing new for the rumour mill, so the information contained within this slide must be considered with caution .  However, most of the details contained are realistic, and the image of the shroud looks identical to the leaked pictures .

"AMD Radeon HD 7970 specifications slide leaked by VR-Zone.com VR-Zone FORUMS PRICEWATCH VIDEOS CHINESE AMD Radeon HD 7970 specifications slide leaked Reported by Sub on Thursday, December 15 2011 4:17 am A slide purportedly to be part of the press deck, detailing Radeon HD 7970, has leaked online .  As previously rumoured, the HD 7970 features the GCN architecture with 32 CUs .  Tweet NEWS A slide purportedly detailing Radeon HD 7970 has leaked online .  The slide resembles AMD's standard presentation design, and is seemingly part of the press deck held .  Aspreviously rumoured, the HD 7970 features the GCN architecture .  The HD 7970 features 32 CU containing 2048 ALUs, clocked at 925 MHz .  This amounts to 3.5 TFLOPS (Single Precision).  TMUs are upped to 128, as expected .  However, ROPs remain at 32 compared to Cayman, which is odd considering the memory bus, as we have observed, is 384-bit .  Memory speed remains unchanged at 5.5 GHz, meaning a 50% boost in memory bandwidth .  The TDP is rated under 300W, while the idle power is incredibly only 3W .  This means a 8-pin + 6-pin power connector configuration .  HD 7970 features 4 display outs - 1x DVI, 2xmini-DisplayPort and 1x HDMI .  Finally, the slide mentions the embargo release date - 9th January 2012 .  Needless to say, faked slides are nothing new for the rumour mill, so the information contained within this slide must be considered with caution .  However, most of the details contained are realistic, and the image of the shroud looks identical to the leaked pictures .

"AMD Radeon HD 7970 specifications slide leaked by VR-Zone.com VR-Zone FORUMS PRICEWATCH VIDEOS CHINESE AMD Radeon HD 7970 specifications slide leaked Reported by Sub on Thursday, December 15 2011 4:17 am A slide purportedly to be part of the press deck, detailing Radeon HD 7970, has leaked online .  As previously rumoured, the HD 7970 features the GCN architecture with 32 CUs .  Tweet NEWS A slide purportedly detailing Radeon HD 7970 has leaked online .  The slide resembles AMD's standard presentation design, and is seemingly part of the press deck held .  Aspreviously rumoured, the HD 7970 features the GCN architecture .  The HD 7970 features 32 CU containing 2048 ALUs, clocked at 925 MHz .  This amounts to 3.5 TFLOPS (Single Precision).  TMUs are upped to 128, as expected .  However, ROPs remain at 32 compared to Cayman, which is odd considering the memory bus, as we have observed, is 384-bit .  Memory speed remains unchanged at 5.5 GHz, meaning a 50% boost in memory bandwidth .  The TDP is rated under 300W, while the idle power is incredibly only 3W .  This means a 8-pin + 6-pin power connector configuration .  HD 7970 features 4 display outs - 1x DVI, 2xmini-DisplayPort and 1x HDMI .  Finally, the slide mentions the embargo release date - 9th January 2012 .  Needless to say, faked slides are nothing new for the rumour mill, so the information contained within this slide must be considered with caution .  However, most of the details contained are realistic, and the image of the shroud looks identical to the leaked pictures .

And the colors, while often "" cartoony "" in saturation at the stores, are now merely bright and natural .  Dramatic colors look dramatic; skin tones look like skin tones .  This set looks as good as or better than any comparably priced LCD, LCoS, or DLP I've seen .  I certainly don't mean to hijack this thread so I'll just end by saying I'm not going to tell you you're wrong - but I have a feeling your opinion may be based on less hands-on experience with these sets than my own .

"Wow SoftwireEngineer - those are some seriously nice speakers!  I appreciate all the tips .  I am currently using virbapods on my cd players and my rack unit weights a hefty 100 lbs (without gear) so I am not too concerned about additional vibrations as the thing is solid as a rock .  I will look into the cables you suggested but think that the whole polished CD thing is a bit much (no offence intended).  As for power conditioning, don't laugh but I am currently using a Monster HTS3500 which seems to meet my needs nicely for the time being .  Thanks again for the tips and feedback.",Monster HTS3500

Much of this adjustability is different with the different AVR manufacturers .  I will use Onkyo as an example since I know their features the best .  Most Onkyo receivers have an adjustable manual EQ .  They also have tone controls that can be adjusted along with the manual EQ .  This is the part you need to remember .  If you're using Audyssey you cannot use the manual EQ .  You can however still use the tone control .  Which is bass and treble only .  No midrange control .  I don't think any modern AVRs have a mid control in the tone control .  Just bass and treble .  So with an Onkyo you could adjust the mid area with the manual EQ if you weren't using Audyssey.,Onkyo receivers

"Bought the 47LW5300 set on Black Friday from Walmart on Ship-to-store (just missed the Amazon deal).  Have it setup in a 2nd room as I need a larger entertainment center for it .

"Please accept my apology, I must admit I have not searched this entire thread for my issue .  It may be that it just is what it is .  My HDPVR seems to be working great .  My main issue is when I record shows, I get huge black bars on the top and bottom of the resulting .ts file .  When I just watch the show on the TV, it looks fine .  The recordings are bordering on unusable because the video is such a small strip in the middle of the screen .  I have searched high and low for some possible settings, but cannot find any .  I'm also having issues out of the Blaster config, but that issue can be addressed later .  The HDPVR is connected to a DirecTV HR-20 DVR via component cables .  If more information is needed to help me address this issue, please let me know .  Any help is certainly appreciated .  Steve PS .  The areas highlighted in red in the attached jpg are what I am referring to.",DirecTV HR-20 DVR

"Quote: Originally Posted by MichaelLAX I have two DirecTiVo HD HR10-250s and two DirecTV HD HR20-700s .  I find the situation of recording from the newer HR20-700 even better than the older model .  In the older model, you had to manually change the resolution to 480i so that you could get a video signal out of the S-Video port, and then you manually had to change it back to 1080i to watch it in that resolution on your HDTV after recording .  Now the HR20-700 outputs a video signal from all of the Video ports even when the HDMI is sending 1080i to the HDTV .  I find that the video signal is anamorphic either when I record it to my Panny VHS/DVD Recorder (although I have to record it on a DVD-RW and use my computer to fix the aspect ratio setting on the resulting DVD-R) and on my ADS Tech Instant DVD (for Mac) MPEG-2 digitizer box (which I use when I want to edit down the resulting digitized content before I burn it to a DVD or convert it to H.264 for my Apple TV).  I am very happy now that I can DVD record (or digitize) all of the new 16x9 HD channels that DirecTV has to offer.. . Good luck!  Thanks for your reply .  I like the fact that you don't have to change the resolution .

Have one firewire cable going from the cable box to the DVHS VCR, and another firewire cable going from the DVHS VCR to the T165 .  Connect the T165 to your TV (tune the T165 to view the DVHS).  This will let you know if a signal is reaching the DVHS .  Quote: Originally Posted by tabrech Some guys also told me the Mitsubishi won't work with a firewire cable boxes .

I can't recall if I've tried to use my Mits 2000u with my cable box, but I'd be really surprised if it didn't also work flawlessly (I'll try to run a test in the next day or so).  The Mits DVHS VCR's are not 5c compliant, so you can only record material which is flagged Copy-Freely .  The JVC DVHS VCR's are 5c compliant and let you record anything flagged Copy-Freely or Copy-Once.",JVC DVHS VCR

"Question for the 876 owners out there.. .. .. . I have an 876 that Ive had for about a year and a half or so .  I have a cable box and ps3 and sony bluray player hooked up to it via HDMI .  I have a 5.1 speaker array connected (klipsch speakers).. .. . Ive always noticed that the audible volume is always higher when watching tv or playing a ps3 game like Call of duty .  The volume setting on the unit in these cases can be set around -30db .  However, when I play a movie, I need to turn the volume up to about -12db .  which seems like its a pretty high volume setting for the actual volume levels im hearing .  Its been like this since I have had the receiver, but I never really bothered to ask anyone if its correct or not .  So.. .. .. does this sound normal??  or is it possible that I do not have something set up correctly on the reciever or the ps3 or bluray player.. .. .. Thanks all for the great reading in this post!!!!!",ps3

Changing channels from standard def to hi-def usually causes a reset HDMI handshake during the resolution change and fixes the problem, otherwise we power cycle everything and all is fine .  It happens periodically, but is not enough of a pain to do anything drastic.","56"" JVC"

To answer your question someone tried to use it with Solaris for ZFS and here is what they replied .  Plans for a driver release near the end of Q3 .  Dear Sir, in our plan, we will release the driver for solaris as soon as the 6G SAS HBA available, the planned schedule is the end of Q3 .  the driver can be used for 6G and 3G SAS HBA both .  sorry for the inconvenience .

"I have a question for any previous DILA owners .  I have the P61R1U, It is my third DILA set .  I had the HD61Z575 and the HD56G886 previously .  My set seems substantially darker than the other 2 sets I had .  It is very noticeable to me, especially during movies .  Daytime scenes look almost as if they should be nightime scenes .  It is the same from my stb and oppo dvd player .  I am just curious if any other previous DILA owners feel this set is darker than the others .  I use the hdmi connections, but have hooked up componant cables with no difference.",P61R1U

"Anaxagoras said: And like TaoTeJared I had a few wacky overexposures - about 6 out of 750 shots .  Thank god!  (Well not really) but I was starting to think I was going mad with that .  I wouldn't consider a D90 at this point unless you are fine upgrading again in a year .  I haven't seen many on ebay go for less than $650 and the tech is 6 years old .  Tamron has some good Super zoom lenses you may want to consider as well .  It seems you were focused on f2.8 glass, but 60% of your shooting will be done at f/8 or higher .  You could go with any decent super-zoom or the 18-105 and pick up a older 50mm 1.8 for portraits when you want bokeh .  Just a note on the "" 4-year extended warranty "" - if you are buying new, I personally wouldn't bother .  Nikon will cover everything for a few years, and the D7000 is built very well .  It is rare that anything goes bad past the first year and honestly in 4 years, you will probably be looking to upgrade .  Heavy use can add to the chance, but you don't sound like you will be doing 100k+ photos a year .  That might save you some $$for a lens or adding a 50mm as well.",D90

So i just wanna know even when the Klipsch are old would it be a smart to buy them at that price?  or woul it be better to go for the pioneer?  Unless the speakers are damaged I would pay $250 for the Klipsch because that sounds like a really good deal, but fwiw, that isn't considered a Klipsch "" High end system. "" Later on if you wanted to upgrade your mains to a Klipsch high end system you could use some of those other speakers in the mix .  Good Luck and welcome to the forum.",Pioneer SP-PK21BS

"As of Feb 2012, I'd like to buy a small off-the-shelf HTPC for HDMI hookup to my Sony Bravia KDL 52W4100 HDTV but I'm reading about a lot problems with HDMI audio and complicated work arounds and patches depending on the equipment configuration .  I realize I can use HDMI or VGA or S-Video for picture plus RCA cables for audio, but I'd like to keep it all digital and uncluttered .  That's what HDMI is for, isn't it?  I'm open to any major computer brand running Windows 7 Home as long as it works right out of the box .  My uses are internet, Netflix, Blockbuster, Hulu, Itunes, adult video websites and OpenOffice word processing .  I prefer an HTPC with 4GB RAM, 1TB HD, wireless keyboard and mouse, DVD RW burner, ethernet, memory card readers, HDMI, USB 2 (& USB 3 if possible) and WI FI .  I've looked at specs for the new Mac Mini (with Bootcamp PC partition), HP Slimline, Gateway SX, Lenovo Revo, Dell Inspiron, Acer, Asus, E-Machines, etc. and they all seem to have HDMI audio problems with Sony Bravia, but it's too expensive a TV to replace so I'm building my home entertainment system around it .  I currently use a Sony PS3 for Blue Ray DVD playback and Netflix streaming, but the PS3 Explorer 6 browser is limited in streaming video from other websites and won't accept software upgrades other than from Sony and Netflix .  Can anyone recommend a ready made HTPC for under $1, 000 because I can't build my own .  Thanks.",HP Slimline

The Anthem did not have ARC run, it just simply sounded great - but, I really wanted AirPlay built in .  The MRX500 would be really stretching the budget, and adding an Apple TV adds more pain .  Assuming I can't swing the MRX-500, what would be a recommendation for something with similar 'sound' to Anthem, that does have AirPlay?  I was thinking Yamaha .  4) If you guys had to build out your system over a couple months, which of these would you do to start with: Fronts/surrounds and phantom center, no sub Fronts and center, no surrounds/sub Fronts and sub, phantom center, no surrounds Really excited about the Studio 20's, they really blew the doors off everything else for HT I listened to .

I've seen grills on eBay before but you'll have to be patient to find another one .  Attached Image (Click thumbnail to expand) dingus Posted: October 16, 2006 05:27 pm How can people be so cruel?  Group: Admin Posts: 6600 Member No.: 3 Joined: June 29, 2006 the woofers look fine to me .  never heard the 1090's but my guess is they would be a step up from the 810 .  as for how they compare to the L-1090's, guessing again, i doubt there is any significant sonic difference .  the pair you have a line on look to be in very condition .  if the price is low enough, in a worst case scenario you could flip them for a nice profit .  ------------------- - AR MGC-1, M&K V-B1, Pioneer VSX 47TX, Oppo BDP-83, Squeezebox v3, Vortexbox Appliance .  thedelihaus Posted: October 16, 2006 05:27 pm The Black Dahlquist Group: Moderator Posts: 2615 Member No.: 9 Joined: June 30, 2006 Price is $200 or best offer - the cabs are scratched up lots though - hard to see in the pic .  I don't need another pair of speakers, but since they are fairly close, I could let a few pieces go to raise the cash for them if I really wanted.. .

I really don't understand how the 4x4 matrix interacts with an AV receiver .  For example here my my future equipment .  AV Receiver, Cable Box, Bluray, Laptop and 4 TV's .  I also have in wall speakers in every room with two of the rooms being 5.1 setups .  How do I wire this all up to have the AV receiver process and output HD sound from blurays and HDbox?",samsung blue ray DVD
"Here are the spread sheet picture calibration tables for the LG 42LD550 I own .  I will add tables for each input I have adjusted .  This is a lot of work and hours of run time and adjusting using a Spyder 3 Pro as well as the Avia DVD, and final viewing using several personal reference DVDs, "" Seabiscuit "" being a favorite for it's color balance and mono chrome picture content .  I feel confident that these settings should work for the xxLD520 as well .  I have settings for normal viewing in daylight conditions, night time, and for HDMI DVD inputs, a warm setting, as well as a bit cooler than 6500K settings for people like my wife who prefer that picture color temperature .  Again, I will add the tables as I complete them so check back as I edit and add them .  EDIT: See next post #61",LG 42LD550
